THIS IS THE B-E-VOTING SOFTWARE 

IMPORTANT:
In order to have this software function on your machine, you must first have SQL database installed on your computer and turned on. Then you must open SQL and create a database called 'BEVOTING'. The line to accomplish this once you're in sql is 'CREATE DATABASE BEVOTING'. 

The final thing to do is to go into the DatabaseController.java file and find the final private String called 'Password'. You will have to change this string to your SQL password. 

After this all you need to do is run the project and enjoy regular voting activities.
