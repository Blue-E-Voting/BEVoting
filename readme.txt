THIS IS THE B-E-VOTING SOFTWARE 

IMPORTANT:

The only thing to do in order to make this software relative to your machine is to go into the DatabaseController.java file and change the string userName and string password to your sql username and password. These are located on lines 24 and 25. 

After this all you need to do is run the project and enjoy regular voting activities.
